# Polymesh - The Polymath Blockchain

Polymesh is a blockchain for regulated securities and open finance.

# Whitepaper

https://polymath.network/polymesh-whitepaper

# Build

Install Rust:

```bash
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```

Install required tools:

```bash
./scripts/init.sh
```

The Polymesh repo includes submodules that link to other Github repos. To ensure these are synced out before building you can execute:  

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Build Wasm and native code:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

Run unit tests:

```bash
./scripts/test.sh
```

# Branches

 - The `develop` branch is the working branch with the latest code changes.
 - The `alcyone` branch tracks code deployed to the Polymesh Alcyone Public Testnet.
 - The `tooling` branch tracks the next candidate release for the Polymesh Alcyone Public Testnet.

# Polymesh Alcyone Public Testnet

The Polymesh Alcyone Public Testnet can be viewed at:  
https://stats.polymesh.live/#list/Polymesh%20Alcyone%20Testnet

The latest tagged commit for the public testnet can be found at:  
https://github.com/PolymathNetwork/Polymesh/releases

To join the Polymesh Alcyone Public Testnet, you can build against the latest Polymesh release.

Specifying no chain at the command line defaults to the Polymesh Alcyone Public Testnet (e.g. `--chain alcyone`), so to run a node which connects to the Alcyone Public Testnet, you can start your node with:

```bash
./target/release/polymesh
```

# Debug

## Environment

Install GDB for your distribution.

## Build

Binary should be built in *debug mode*, using `cargo build` without `--release` parameter:  

```bash
cargo build
```

Test cases are built in *debug mode* by default.

## Using GDB

Using `rust-gdb` you will get pretty printed values for more types than directly with `gdb`.

The following example, starts `gdb`, sets a breakpoint, and starts our compiled `polymesh`:

```bash
$> rust-gdb ./target/debug/polymesh

# Development

## Single node development chain

You can start a development chain with:

```bash
./target/release/polymesh --dev
```

Detailed logs may be shown by running the node with the following environment variables set:  
`RUST_LOG=debug RUST_BACKTRACE=1 ./target/release/polymesh --dev`.

[Web Interface]: https://app.polymesh.live/#/explorer

To access the Polymesh Chain using the [Web Interface] do the following:

1. Click on the Polymath logo in the top-right corner of the UI. You can then select "Local Node" under the Development section.

   > Note: if the `polymesh` node above is on a different machine than your browser (e.g., a server on your local network), you'll need to use a *"custom endpoint"*, e.g., `ws://192.168.0.100:9944/`.
   > The [Web Interface] uses `https`, but your `polymesh` instance does not, so you'll need `ws://` as opposed to `wss://`. You'll also need to use `http://httpapp.polymesh.live/` instead of [Web Interface]. Otherwise, you'll have problems with mixed-content blocking (https vs. http).
   > Finally, add `--rpc-external --ws-external --rpc-cors all` to the `polymesh` invocation above.

2. If you have [custom types definitions](https://github.com/PolymathNetwork/Polymesh/blob/alcyone/polymesh_schema.json) that differ from the Polymesh Alcyone Public Testnet, you can update these in [Settings](https://app.polymesh.live/#/settings) tab under the `Developer` section.

3. Reload the page.

## Multi-node local testnet

If you want to see the multi-node consensus algorithm in action locally, then you can create a local testnet with two validator nodes for Alice and Bob, who are the initial authorities of the genesis chain that have been endowed with testnet units.

```bash
cd scripts/cli
npm install
./run.sh
```

This uses pm2 to run a local three node network for demonstrate simple consensus.

To stop the chain you can use:

```bash
./stop.sh
```

and to display log files you can use:
```bash
./log.sh
```

# Unit Tests

Unit tests are packaged with the Rust code. To run these, you can execute:

```bash
cargo test --package polymesh-runtime-tests  --features default_identity
cargo test --package pallet-staking
cargo test --package pallet-balances
cargo test --package pallet-im-online
cargo test --package polymesh-primitives
cargo test --package pallet-pips-rpc
cargo test --package pallet-transaction-payment
```

# Initialise

You can seed the network with some identities, claims, signing keys and assets by running the functional test.

```bash
cd scripts/cli
node run test
```

See [README](https://github.com/PolymathNetwork/Polymesh/tree/develop/scripts/cli) for details.

# Benchmark

Polymesh runtime benchmarks can be run with a command that specifies the pallet and the name of the
extrinsic to be benchmarked, for example:

```bash
cargo run --release --features runtime-benchmarks -- \
    benchmark --pallet asset --extrinsic register_asset
```

Note that the CLI binary should be built in release mode and that the feature flag
`runtime-benchmarks` should be set to enable the CLI option `benchmark`.
