//! # Corporate Actions module.
//!
//! The corporate actions module provides functionality for handling corporate actions (CAs) on-chain.
//!
//! Any CA is associated with an asset,
//! so most module dispatchables must be called by the corporate action agent (CAA).
//! The CAA could either be the asset's owner, or some specific identity authorized by the owner.
//! Should the CAA be distinct from the owner, then only the CAA may initiate CAs.
//! If for any reason, a CAA needs to be relieved from their responsibilities,
//! they may be removed using `reset_caa`, in which case the CAA again becomes the owner.
//!
//! The starting point of any CA begins with executing `initiate_corporate_action`,
//! provided with the associated ticker, what sort of CA it is, e.g., a notice or a benefit,
//! and when, if any, a checkpoint should be recorded, or was recorded, if an existing one is to be used.
//! Additonally, free-form details, serving as on-chain documentation, may be provided.
//!
//! A CA targets a set of identities (`TargetIdentities`), but this need not be every asset holder.
//! Instead, when initiating a CA,
//! the targets may be specified either by exhaustively specifying every identity to include.
//! This is achieved through `TargetTreatment::Include`.
//! Instead of specifying an exhaustive set,
//! a set of identities can be excluded from the universe of asset holders.
//! This can be achieved through `TargetTreatment::Exclude`.
//! If the target set for an asset is usually the same,
//! a default may be specified through `set_default_targets(targets)`.
//!
//! Finally, CAs which imply some sort of benefit may have a taxable element, e.g., due to capital gains tax.
//! Sometimes, the responsibiliy paying such tax falls to the CAA or the asset issuer.
//! To handle such circumstances, a portion of the benefits may be withheld.
//! This governed by specifying a withholding tax % on-chain.
//! The tax is first and foremost specified for every identity,
//! but may also be overriden for specific identities (e.g., for DIDs in different jurisdictions).
//! As with targets, if the taxes are usually the same for every CA,
//! asset-level defaults may also be specified with `set_default_withholding_tax`
//! and `set_did_withholding_tax`.
//!
//! After having created a CA and some asset documents,
//! such documents may also be linked to the CA.
//! To do so, `link_ca_doc(ca_id, docs)` can be called,
//! with the ID of the CA specified in `ca_id` as well the IDs of each document in `docs`.
//!
//! Beyond this module, two other modules exist dedicated to CAs. These are:
//!
//! - The corporate ballots module, with which e.g., annual general meetings can be conducted on-chain.
//! - The capital distributions module, with which e.g., dividends and other benefits may be distributed.
//!
//! For more details, consult the documentation in those modules.
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! The module provides functions for:
//!
//! - Configuring the max length of details (chain global configuration, through PIPs)
//! - Specifying asset level CA configuration for the target set and withholding tax.
//! - Initiating CAs.
//! - Linking existing asset documentation to an existing CA.
//!
//! ## Interface
//!
//! ### Dispatchable Functions
//!
//! - `set_max_details_length(origin, length)` sets the maximum `length` in bytes for the `details` of any CA.
//!    Must be called via the PIP process.
//! - `reset_caa(origin, ticker)` relieves the current CAA from their duties,
//!    resetting it back to the asset owner. Must be called by the asset owner.
//! - `set_default_targets(origin, ticker, targets)` sets the default `targets`
//!    for all CAs associated with `ticker`.
//! - `set_default_withholding_tax(origin, ticker, tax)` sets the default withholding tax
//!    for every identity for all CAs associated with `ticker`.
//! - `set_did_withholding_tax(origin, ticker, taxed_did, tax)` sets a withholding tax
//!    for CAs associated with `ticker` and specific to `taxed_did` to `tax`,
//!    or resets the tax of `taxed_did` to the default if `tax` is `None`.
//! - `initiate_corporate_action(...)` initates a corporate action.
//! - `link_ca_doc(origin, id, docs)` is called by the CAA to associate `docs` to the CA with `id`.
//! - `remove_ca(origin, id)` removes the CA identified by `id`.
